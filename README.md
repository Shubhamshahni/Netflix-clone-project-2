# Netflix Clone

Introducing my second project - a Netflix Clone! ðŸŽ¥  
This project is crafted using **HTML** and **CSS** to replicate the look and feel of Netflix's homepage. It focuses on responsive design, layout structuring, and styling to improve my front-end development skills. Although it doesn't include any functionality, itâ€™s a visual representation of my growing expertise.  

Check it out and let me know your thoughts! ðŸŒŸ
